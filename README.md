MartianRobots
=============
Java Version = 1.8

Hello :), The demonstration of the solution is at the bottom of the MarsTest (MartianRobots/src/test/java/martianRobots/MarsTest.java). Thank you for your time and consideration.

As I'm sure you have noticed, I have used Gradle in this project. It is unnecessary for the running of this program. It is included as a convenience only.
As long as you have junit 4.11 installed or a compatible version, you should be able to run the tests.
If you do not have junit, you can install it by using Gradle. From the console type "gradle (test or build)" which will install the proper version
of junit for you. If you do not have Gradle you can type "./gradlew (test or build)" which will do the same thing.
If you are using Intellij, you can type "(gradle or ./gradlew) idea" and open the project via the ipr file it will create. I find this to be
a more stable way of setting it up in Intellij.
