=============

Java Version = 1.8

Hello :), The demonstration of the solution is available by running the main in Houston (MartianRobots/src/main/java/Houston.java) or by typing gradle blastoff in the console. Thank you for your time and consideration.

As I'm sure you have noticed, I have used Gradle in this project. It is now necessary for the running of this program.
From the console type "gradle (test or build)" which will install the proper version
of the dependencies for you. If you do not have Gradle you can type "./gradlew (test or build)" which will do the same thing.
If you are using Intellij, you can type "(gradle or ./gradlew) idea" and open the project via the ipr file it will create. I find this to be
a more stable way of setting it up in Intellij.
